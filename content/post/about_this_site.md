# Hugo, a static page generator
This website is powerd by [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/), which is a static page generator.

A lot of web-services is putting together what you see when you ask for it. This enables a site to display different content according to a state.

But a **static** web-page is just delivering what already is on the server, and not building anything new on the spot. 

> *Of course you can go around this by making the dynamic stuff happen on the client side, like a [pwa](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) often do... but thats not relevant for this discussion.*

This makes hosting cheap and simple. As you don't need any server spinning up a VM or anything for delivering your webpage. In fact, this site is hosted for free on GitHub and I'm only paying for the domain.

# Getting started with Hugo
## Installing
Install Hugo. If you are using a Mac, it's as easy as writing:
