I start in my [new job at Olavstoppen](/post/olavstoppen/) the 1st of April.
Yesterday I got an email with some more information on what technology I will be using: ***React, React-Native and Redux.***

I have some knowledge with React from one small project in class ( and some tinkering on my own ), but I can't say that I'm a pro. Not yet at least. 

> My goal is to (1.) get efficient in writing code in React, then  (2.) get comfortable with the basics of React Native and also (3.)  have a good enough understanding of the workings of Redux. 
> ... and all this in 10 days. Wish me good luck!

So... That was the introduction to the series "Henry is getting ready for Olavstoppen". You can find the other posts by following the tag "[Getting Ready 4 OT](/tags/getting-ready-4-ot/)".
