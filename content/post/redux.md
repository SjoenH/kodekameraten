This post is me trying to get the basics of redux under control.

Getting started with Redux, you should know about the _Store_, _Action_, _Dispatcher_, _Reducer_ &  _Subscriber_.

{{< youtube KcC8KZ_Ga2M >}}

## Store

Stores all the stuff

## Action

You write actions to modify the state.

## Dispatcher

You dispatch an action to an reducer.

## Reducer

The reducer _does_ the action on the store.

## Subscriber

Listens to changes? or something...
