This post is me trying to get the basics of redux under control.

Getting started with Redux, you should know about the *Store*, *Action*, *Dispatcher*, *Reducer* &  *Subscriber*.

{{< youtube KcC8KZ_Ga2M >}}

## Store
Stores all the stuff
## Action
You write actions to modify the state.
## Dispatcher
You dispatch an action to an reducer.
## Reducer
The reducer *does* the action on the store.
## Subscriber
Listens to changes? or something...
